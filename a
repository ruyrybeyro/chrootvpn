To be honest, did not have high hopes. While i am old enough to have watched the old Quantum Leap, was never a fan of it.

The original was already an unfortunate plot, and the saving grace of it was the charisma of the main actor. This one is a remake of a weak series worse off with Holywood man-hating agenda and several diversity tick boxes.

Have seen worse, the show is passable, however the stories have no depth and appeal. They are fairly boring. The main actor is quite good, but it does not save the series.
